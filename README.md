# Shake RP2350

**Shake RP2350** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with Nuxt 3 to interact with RP2350 IoT devices. The application allows users to upload `.uf2` binary files to the RP2350 filesystem using the modern **File System Access API** for seamless file management.

This application is styled with TailwindCSS, supports drag-and-drop file uploads, and integrates Google AdSense for monetization.

- **Progressive Web Application:**
  - Installable and offline-ready with PWA features.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Styled with TailwindCSS for a modern and mobile-friendly UI.
